This project demonstrates how to use **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** in Python to analyze and process large text data and build intelligent spelling recommender systems.

> **Note:** This repository was created as a personal learning project to demonstrate natural language processing techniques with NLTK. It is not affiliated with any course or institution.

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ **Part 1: Text Analysis**
- Tokenizes a large collection of movie plot summaries.
- Calculates:
  - Total number of tokens
  - Number of unique tokens
  - Lexical diversity
  - Word frequencies and distributions
  - Most frequent parts of speech
  - Longest token
- Performs lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
- Computes statistics like percentage occurrence of specific words (e.g., *love*).

‚úÖ **Part 2: Spelling Recommender**
- Builds three spelling recommendation engines using:
  - **Jaccard distance** on trigrams
  - **Jaccard distance** on 4-grams
  - **Edit distance** (Levenshtein distance) with transpositions
- Suggests closest-correct spellings for example misspelled words.

## üõ† Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nltk-text-analysis.git
   cd nltk-text-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install nltk pandas numpy
   ```

3. **Download NLTK resources:**

## üöÄ How to Run

1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure `plots.txt` is in the same directory as `text_analysis.py`.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script:

```bash
python text_analysis.py
```

or open the notebook version if you prefer interactive exploration.
